Some people decide they want to pool their funds together in a smart contract to create a collateral pool in case any of them want to borrow ERC20 assets.

They want to earn interest on their collateral while also allowing borrowing against it.

Prospective members will need to contribute 10,000 DAI in order to successfully join.

This DAI will serve as the collateral for any member who wishes to borrow against the group's assets.

After all debts have been paid, members will be able to retrieve their initial deposit plus any interest earned.

The idea is that the members would know each other beforehand and can on some level trust each other to repay back loans that may be larger than their individual collateral contribution.
